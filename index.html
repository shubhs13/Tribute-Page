                <p style="text-align:center">When posed with the question of who the "best" member of the Avengers, the conversation has to start and end with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" target="_blank">Iron Man</a></p>

                <h1>Who's Iron Man?</h1>
                    <p>When Tony Stark, an industrialist, is captured, he constructs a high-tech armoured suit to escape. Once he manages to escape, he decides to use his suit to fight against evil forces to save the world.</p>
                    <p>In the late 2000s, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.</p>

                    <p>Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor</p>

                    <p>Stark learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being "Iron Man."</p>

                    <h1>And We Lose Our Super Hero.</h1>
                    <p>During an ensuing battle during Infinity War, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to fling Stark away before attempting another snap, but discovers that Stark has caused all of the Infinity Stones to move to Stark's own armor. Stark then uses them to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces, saving the universe but fatally injuring himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker, and Potts. A funeral attended by many heroes is later held for him at his homestead.</p><img src="images/main.jpg">
                    <h4>It’s Not About How Much We Lost, It’s About How Much We Have Left. We’re The Avengers. We Gotta Finish This.</h4>
                    
                    <h1>Did he left Something.</h1>
                    <p>Eight months later, the world continues to mourn Stark. Parker receives glasses that can access Stark's artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., with a message that establishes him as Stark's successor.</p>
